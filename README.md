# NTLM Relay Gat

![gat](img/gat.png)

## Description

NTLM Relay Gat is a powerful tool designed to automate the exploitation of NTLM relays using `ntlmrelayx.py` from the Impacket tool suite. By leveraging the capabilities of `ntlmrelayx.py`, NTLM Relay Gat streamlines the process of exploiting NTLM relay vulnerabilities, offering a range of functionalities from listing SMB shares to executing commands on MSSQL databases.

## Features

- **Multi-threading Support**: Utilize multiple threads to perform actions concurrently.
- **SMB Shares Enumeration**: List available SMB shares.
- **SMB Shell Execution**: Execute a shell via SMB.
- **Secrets Dumping**: Dump secrets from the target.
- **MSSQL Database Enumeration**: List available MSSQL databases.
- **MSSQL Command Execution**: Execute operating system commands via xp_cmdshell or start SQL Server Agent jobs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- `proxychains` properly configured with ntlmrelayx SOCKS relay port
- Python 3.6+

## Installation
### PyPi
`pipx install ntlm-relay-gat`

### Dev / Manual
To install NTLM Relay Gat, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.

2. Clone NTLM Relay Gat repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ad0nis/ntlm_relay_gat.git
cd ntlm_relay_gat
```

3. Install dependencies, if you don't have them installed already:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NTLM Relay Gat is now installed and ready to use.

## Usage

To use NTLM Relay Gat, make sure you've got relayed sessions in `ntlmrelayx.py`'s `socks` command output and that you have proxychains configured to use `ntlmrelayx.py`'s proxy, and then execute the script with the desired options. Here are some examples of how to run NTLM Relay Gat:

```bash
# List available SMB shares using 10 threads
python ntlm_relay_gat.py --smb-shares -t 10

# Execute a shell via SMB
python ntlm_relay_gat.py --smb-shell --shell-path /path/to/shell

# Dump secrets from the target
python ntlm_relay_gat.py --dump-secrets

# List available MSSQL databases
python ntlm_relay_gat.py --mssql-dbs

# Execute an operating system command via xp_cmdshell
python ntlm_relay_gat.py --mssql-exec --mssql-method 1 --mssql-command 'whoami'
```
